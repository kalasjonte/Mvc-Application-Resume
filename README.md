# Mvc-Application-Resume
An MVC application made with ASP.net and identity authorization. Styled for users to create small resumes
Designed in swedish.

Made for a school project, and the description of it is in the folder uploadedfiles, under the folder grupp2, in swedish.

Was a great experience learning asp.net and MVC, and also the first time i dabbled in ajax calls and apis. A fun time all together.
